# Algorithm

1. use it
2. implement it

# Recursion
- Direct recursion
    -   method m() call itself
    - think how to terminate call yourself
- All recursive programs need
1. at least on stopping condition
2. at least one recursive part, which takes us closer to the stopping condition on each successive call

```
m(){
    if()
        return ...;
    else()
        m();
}
```
